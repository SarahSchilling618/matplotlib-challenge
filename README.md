Module 5 Challenge

This repostiory contains an .ipynb file that can be opened via Jupyter Notebook, which contains analysis of a database based on two csv files, one containing data of mice and another containing data regarding the results of experiments on mice. These two databases were combined to analyze them further and create several graphs based on specific data. These scripts can be executed by opening GitBash in the folders that the original .cvs files that the data was taken from, opening Jupyter Notebook, and opening the file I have provided. This script was written to act on a specific Jupyter Notebook/MatPlotLib workbook as an exercise at the University of Pennsylvania Data Science Bootcamp. I used information that I learned while in class, as well as the XPert Learning Assistant provided on Bootcamp Spot to help complete this assignment. I worked with classmates Victoria Martin-Nelson, Kiet Hoang, Katie Ballinger, and Chau Nguyen on parts of this assignment and worked with code they helped provide.
